# MachEightSampleProject
A simple script that finds pairs of integers from a list that sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers and the target sum.

## How to use the script
* Download the Python script, open a terminal (command, Git Bash), and execute the Python script "python.exe pairs.py".
* The input must be a list of integers separated by "," and the desired sum value separated from that list by a space.
